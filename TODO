Handle situation where no fish are detected at all (arm keeps moving left without end).

Research how to detect fish by color. Hopefully this doesn't involve Haar training each individual fish color, and I can do it by detecting any fish color, then determining the color values within the object detection box to infer which color the fish is.

Use a python state machine library.

More user-friendly documentation which teaches principles as it explains the setup.
